        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
            <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Sliced onions</li>
            <li>Pickles</li>
            <li>Cheese slices (optional)</li>
            <li>Condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic, beaten egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to evenly distribute the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty, about 1/2-inch thick. You can make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
            <li>Preheat a grill or stovetop pan over medium-high heat. Place the hamburger patties on the grill or pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>If desired, during the last minute of cooking, you can top each patty with a slice of cheese and allow it to melt.</li>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, you can prepare the hamburger buns and toppings. Lightly toast the buns on the grill or in a toaster. Arrange the lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, sliced onions, and pickles.</li>
            <li>Once the patties are cooked, transfer them to a plate and let them rest for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Assemble the hamburgers by placing a cooked patty on the bottom half of each bun. Add your desired condiments, such as ketchup, mustard, and mayo.</li>
            <li>Finish assembling the burgers by adding the prepared lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles. Top with the other half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Serve the hamburgers immediately and enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
