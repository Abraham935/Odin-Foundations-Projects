        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound (225g) Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, and beaten egg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat this process, alternating layers of sauce, noodles, and cheese, until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it is tightly sealed. This will help the lasagna to cook evenly and retain moisture.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This will make it easier to cut and serve.</li>
            <li>Slice the lasagna into portions and serve it warm. You can garnish with additional chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
          </ol>
